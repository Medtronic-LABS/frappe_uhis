# every boot, re-materialize sites/ config from the build-time seed, since mounting
# a volume under sites/ shadows whatever was baked into the image there.
#
# common_site_config.json is the one exception -- it's written fresh here, not
# copied from the seed, because db_host/db_port/db_schema are deployment-specific
# values for an existing, already-populated Postgres database/schema (shared with
# another service) that don't exist at image-build time. See
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-18-postgres-reuse-design.md.
